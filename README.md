# archcrowd
As a research project in cloud computing, I developed a cloud architecture aligned with the World Bank's goals to eradicate extreme poverty in the world. The proposed architecture, called ArchCrowd, aims to be a “CrowdFunding-as-a-Service” model that contains its own frontend and API availability for access by external platforms or services for reuse of the exposed functionalities, in this way the architecture applies the concept of SaaS and FaaS. The architecture aims to promote security, availability, scalability, elasticity, modularity, fault tolerance, and ubiquity, allowing that through georeferencing it is possible to identify people with insufficient basic needs and transfer resources to these people. In this way, acting as a tool to the promotion of prosperity and increased economic dynamism.
